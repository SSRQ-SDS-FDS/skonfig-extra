cdist-type__netbox(7)
=====================

NAME
----
cdist-type__netbox - Install and configure NetBox


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This (singleton) type installs and configures a NetBox instance, a web
application to help manage and document computer networks.

It installs it with the user ``netbox`` at ``/opt/netbox`` with `python-venv`.
It setup systemd unit files for the services `netbox` and `netbox-rq`. The
`netbox` service only wrap all netbox related services, e.g. restarting and
so one will be delegated to all related services.

The application is still not accessable because a WSGI server is required. To
access the application through WSGI, uWSGI or Gunicorn can be used. The setup
can be done via there own types `__netbox_gunicorn` and `__netbox_uwsgi`.

The Gunicorn setup is recommended from the NetBox documentation. Consult each
manual page to decide. The types must be called after the `__netbox` type.


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
-------------------
version
    NetBox version to be installed. You can find the correct and newest version
    on GitHub at the NetBox project page under
    "`Releases <https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/releases>`_".

    Too big version jumps can break the NetBox migration path. It's good
    practise to don't skip major versions and common that you must upgrade to
    the latest minor inside the current major version till you can upgrade to
    the next major version. Diffrent version steps must be done manually as
    this type only upgrades to the given version directly.

database
    PostgreSQL database name.

database-user
    PostgreSQL database user.

database-password
    PostgreSQL database password.

host
    Hostname (domain or IP address) on which the application is served.
    Multiple hostnames are possible; given as multiple arguments.


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
-------------------
secret-key
    Random secret key of at least 50 alphanumeric characters and symbols. This
    key must be unique to this installation and must not be shared outside the
    local system. If no secret key is given, the type generates an own 50 chars
    long key and saves it on the remote host to remember it for the next run.

    The secret, random string is used to assist in the creation new
    cryptographic hashes for passwords and HTTP cookies. It is not directly
    used for hasing user passwords or for encrpted storage. It can be changed
    at any time, but will invalidate all existing sessions.

database-host
    PostgreSQL database hostname. Defaults to ``localhost``.

database-port
    PostgreSQL database port. Defaults to empty (uses the default port).

ldap-server
    LDAP server URI. Enables LDAP-backed authentication if specified.

ldap-bind-dn
    DN for the NetBox service account. Required for LDAP authentication.

ldap-bind-password
    Password for the NetBox service account. Required for LDAP authentication.

ldap-user-base
    Base used for searching user entries. Required for LDAP authentication.

ldap-group-base
    Base used for searching group entries.

ldap-require-group
    Group required to login.

ldap-staff-group
    Make members of this group to "staff". This gives the users "Admin Access",
    which means access to the "NetBox Administration" site.

ldap-superuser-group
    Make members of this groups superusers.

redis-host
    Redis database hostname. Defaults to ``localhost``.

redis-port
    Redis database port. Defaults to ``6379``.

redis-password
    Redis password. Defaults to empty password.

redis-dbid-offset
    Offset to set the redis database id's. The `tasks` database id is
    `offset + 0` and `caching` is `offset + 1`. The offset defaults to ``0``.

smtp-host
    Host of the SMTP email server. Defaults to ``localhost``.

smtp-port
    Port of the SMTP email server. Defaults to ``25``.

smtp-user
    Username to access the SMTP email server. Defaults to empty.

smtp-password
    Password to access the SMTP email server. Defaults to empty.

smtp-from-email
    Email from which NetBox will be sent of. Defaults to empty.

basepath
    Base URL path if accessing netbox within a directory instead of directly the
    webroot ``/``. For example, if installed at https://example.com/netbox/, set
    the value ``netbox/``.

https-proxy
    Proxy which will be used with any HTTP request like webhooks.

data-root
    This parameter set's the media, reports and scripts root to subdirectories
    of the given directory. Values can be overwritten by special parameters like
    `--media-root` for example. Use this option if you want to store persistant
    data of netbox on an other partition. A trailing slash is not needed.

    The data directories have following predefined sub-directory names:

    media root:
        ``$data_root/media``
    reports root:
        ``$data_root/reports``
    scripts root:
        ``$data_root/scripts``

    To preserve all data from installation upgrades - which just replace the
    installation directory - the data will be kept in the netbox home directory
    rather than the installation directory by default (``/opt/netbox/data/``).
    This way, no data will be deleted after the installation directory
    replacement because it remains outside of the installation directory.

media-root
    The file path to where media files (like image attachments) are stored.
    Change this path if you require to store data on an other partiotion.
    A trailing slash is not needed. Defaults to ``$data_root/media``.

reports-root
    The file path of where custom reports are kept. Change this path if you
    require to store data on an other partition. A trailing slash is not
    needed. Defaults to ``$data_root/reports``.

scripts-root
    The file path of where custom scripts are kept. Change this path if you
    require to store data on an other partition. A trailing slash is not
    needed. Defaults to ``$data_root/scripts``.


BOOLEAN PARAMETERS
------------------
redis-ssl
    Enables a secure TLS/SSL connection to the redis database. By default, ssl
    is disabled.

smtp-use-tls
    Uses TLS to connect to the SMTP email server. `See documentation
    <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/settings/#email-use-tls>`__
    for more information.

smtp-use-ssl
    Uses implicit TLS with the SMTP email server. `See documentation
    <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/settings/#email-use-ssl>`__
    for more information.

login-required
    Sets if a login is required to access all sites. By default, anonymous
    users can see most data (excluding secrets) but not make any changes.

update-notify
    Enables the NetBox version check for new upstream updates. It checks every
    24 hours for new releases and notify the admin users in the gui if any.


MESSAGES
--------
installed $VERSION
    Netbox was fresh installed or updated. The new version number is appended.

configured
    Some configuration files got updated and therefore the service was
    restarted. This message will not be echoed if configuration got updated due
    a standard installation.


EXAMPLES
--------

.. code-block:: sh

  __netbox --version 2.8.7 --database netbox \
                --database-password "secretsecretsecret" \
                --secret-key "secretsecretsecret" \
                --host "${__target_host:?}" \
                --host "cool-netbox.xyz" \
                --ldap-server "ldaps://ldap.domain.tld" \
                --ldap-bind-dn "uid=netbox,ou=services,dc=domain,dc=tld" \
                --ldap-bind-password "secretsecretsecret" \
                --ldap-user-base "ou=users,dc=domain,dc=tld" \
                --ldap-group-base "ou=groups,dc=domain,dc=tld" \
                --ldap-require-group "cn=netbox-login,ou=groups,dc=domain,dc=tld" \
                --ldap-superuser-group "cn=netbox-admin,ou=groups,dc=domain,dc=tld"
  # using recommended gunicorn setup
  require="__netbox" __netbox_gunicorn


NOTES
-----
The configuration of NetBox contains more optional settings than that what can
be set with this type. If you think an important setting is missing or there
is a more good way to inject python code for dynamic configuration variables,
you are welcome to contribute!

- `Possible optional settings
  <https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration/optional-settings/>`_

If you not setup ldap authentification, you may be interested into how to
`setting up a super user
<https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation/3-netbox/#create-a-super-user>`_
directly on the machine to be able to access and use NetBox.

You may also be interested of writing a own type which handles the creation of
the super user. To do this non-interactivly, see the ansible role as `reference
<https://github.com/lae/ansible-role-netbox/blob/18f46a3345f100936c5116abe716c480e1886676/vars/main.yml#L15>`_.

If you change the secret key while the netbox instance is running, there is a
time frame where the access to the application corrupts the whole database.
Then, you need to restore a backup or wipe the database.

Currently, the cause is not clear, but it should work if you do not touch
netbox while the configuration is done (do not shut it down, too). It only
applies for changes of the secret key, which not happen normally.

Maybe the `--restart` flag for the `__systemd_unit` types is not the best idea,
but avoids that the changes will not be applied. It could be solved if the type
would send messages from his actions.
