# skonfig extra set

This is a set of extra types for use with the [skonfig](https://skonfig.li) configuration management system.

Work is mostly split between three main repositories:

* [skonfig](https://github.com/skonfig/skonfig) - implementation of the **skonfig tool** and quick **getting started** bits,
* [base](https://github.com/skonfig/base) - **base** explorers and types,
* **extra** - **extra** types (community contributions).

## base vs extra?

Explorers and types which are related to changing state of the operating
system or core components of it and are not strictly related to some specific
piece of software, are considered base.
Furthermore, the quality requirements for inclusion in base are higher than for extra.
